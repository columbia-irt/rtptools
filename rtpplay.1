.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rtpplay
.Nd play back RTP sessions recorded by rtpdump
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl hTv
.Op Fl b Ar time
.Op Fl e Ar time
.Op Fl f Ar infile
.Op Fl p Ar profile
.Op Fl s Ar port
.Ar address Ns / Ns Ar port Ns Op / Ns Ar ttl
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads RTP session data recorded by
.Dq rtpdump -F dump ,
from standard input and resends the traffic to the given
.Ar address Ns / Ns Ar port ,
optionally with a time-to-live value of
.Ar ttl .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar time
Skip the first
.Ar time
seconds of input.
.It Fl e Ar time
Only use the first
.Ar time
seconds of input.
.It Fl f Ar infile
Read input from the given
.Ar infile
instead of from standard input.
.It Fl h
Print a short usage summary and exit.
.It Fl p Ar profile
Use the specified
.Ar profile
of payload type to frequency mapping.
By default,
.Nm
uses the frequency profile specified in RFC 1890.
For example, A-law PCM audio will be a single channel
with a sample rate of 8 kHz.
The
.Ar profile
file consists of lines containing two numeric values:
the numeric payload type and the sample rate.
This is silently ignored if
.Fl T
is used.
.It Fl s Ar port
Send packets from the specified
.Ar port .
By default, packets are sent from a random port.
.It Fl T
Time the outgoing RTP packets according to the original arrival time.
By default, the RTP timestamps are used for timing instead.
This smooths jitter and restores the packet sequence.
RTCP packets are always sent with their original arrival timing,
which may change the relative order of RTP and RTCP packets.
.It Fl v
Print the packets to standard output as they are sent out.
By default,
.Nm
operates silently.
