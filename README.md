that can be used for processing RTP data.
Refer to the individual manpages for details.

* **rtpsend**
	generate RTP packets from textual description,
	generated by hand or rtpdump
* **rtpdump**
	parse and print RTP packets,
	generating output files suitable for rtpplay and rtpsend
* **rtptrans**
	RTP translator between unicast and multicast networks
* **multidump**
	Start multiple rtpdumps simultaneously.
* **multiplay**

## Installation

The RTP tools should compile on any
POSIX platform supporting sockets.

When building from a release tarball,
the usual `./configure; make` will compile rtptools.

When building from git, the following sequence
might be needed to regenerate the build tools first:

```
aclocal
autoconf
automake
```
