## Installation

The RTP tools should compile on any Posix-compliant platform

On Unix systems, the usual `./configure; make` will compile rtptools.

### Windows

The `*.dsp` files are project files. `*.dsw` file and workspace file.
User can open the workspace file and use 'batch compile'
to compile all the projects.

* In Visual C++ 6.0, open workspace file rtptools.dsw.
* In VC menu Build, use Batch Build to build all the tools.
* All the rtptools will be created under the "debug\" directory.
